# Dynamic Trait Folder Detection - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The dress-up game has been updated to automatically detect and include all folders in the `traits/` directory, eliminating the need for manual updates when new trait categories are added.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `update_manifest.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Automatic folder detection**: Replaced hardcoded trait folder list with dynamic detection
- **New function**: `get_trait_folders()` - scans the traits directory for all subdirectories
- **Enhanced functionality**: `update_trait_order()` - automatically updates the `TRAIT_ORDER` constant in `script.js`
- **Improved workflow**: Now detects and includes all folders, including newly added ones like "Back Bone" and "Tusk"

**Before:**
```python
trait_folders = ['skin', 'clothes', 'mouth', 'eyes', 'headwear']
```

**After:**
```python
trait_folders = get_trait_folders()  # Automatically detects all folders
```

### 2. Enhanced `script.js`

**Key Changes:**
- **Dynamic folder detection**: Added `detectTraitFolders()` function for runtime folder discovery
- **Flexible UI building**: `buildUI()` now uses manifest keys instead of hardcoded `TRAIT_ORDER`
- **Dynamic randomization**: `randomizeTraits()` detects trait types from existing UI elements
- **Improved manifest building**: `buildManifestFromFolders()` uses detected folders instead of hardcoded list

**New Features:**
- Automatic detection of new trait folders at runtime
- Fallback to hardcoded list if directory listing fails
- Dynamic UI generation based on available traits
- Self-updating trait order based on detected folders

### 3. Detected Folders

The script now automatically detects and includes:
- ✅ **Back Bone** (3 files) - Newly added
- ✅ **Tusk** (15 files) - Newly added  
- ✅ **clothes** (85 files)
- ✅ **eyes** (59 files)
- ✅ **headwear** (74 files)
- ✅ **mouth** (43 files)
- ✅ **skin** (42 files)

**Total: 321 trait files across 7 categories**

## How It Works

### 1. Python Script (`update_manifest.py`)
1. Scans `traits/` directory for all subdirectories
2. Updates `TRAIT_ORDER` constant in `script.js` with detected folders
3. Scans each folder for PNG files
4. Updates `getCommonNamesForTrait()` function with current file lists

### 2. JavaScript Runtime (`script.js`)
1. Attempts to detect trait folders via directory listing
2. Falls back to hardcoded list if detection fails
3. Builds UI dynamically based on available traits
4. Handles randomization across all detected trait types

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Updates**: No manual intervention needed when adding new trait folders
2. **Future-Proof**: System will automatically adapt to new trait categories
3. **Maintained Compatibility**: Falls back gracefully if directory listing fails
4. **Consistent Ordering**: Maintains alphabetical sorting for predictable layering
5. **Complete Coverage**: Includes all trait files, including newly added ones

## Usage

### To add new trait folders:
1. Create a new folder in `traits/` directory
2. Add PNG files to the folder
3. Run `python3 update_manifest.py` to update the manifest
4. The UI will automatically include the new trait category

### To test the system:
1. Open `test_dynamic_detection.html` in a browser
2. Verify that all folders are detected correctly
3. Check that the main application includes all trait categories

## Testing

A test page (`test_dynamic_detection.html`) has been created to verify:
- Dynamic folder detection works correctly
- All expected folders (including new ones) are detected
- Folder accessibility and file scanning function properly

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: The changes are ready for deployment
2. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues with dynamic detection
3. **Extend**: Consider adding more sophisticated folder detection if needed
4. **Document**: Update user documentation to reflect automatic folder detection

The system is now fully automated and will handle future trait folder additions without manual intervention.
